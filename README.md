<p>
I love writing code! Before becoming a Software Engineer, I completed a degree in <strong> Mathematics and Physics </strong> from <strong> University of Toronto </strong>. When I was studying physics, I dabbled in programming and found my passion for it. When I graduated with my degree, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. So I went back to school for Computer Science.

<p>
ðŸ‘€ Over the past few years, i became proficent at <strong> Java, Python, Typescript</strong> and familiar with <strong>C++</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
ðŸŒ± Currently, my projects primarily involve developing solutions using Java and TypeScript.
