<h1> Hi! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
 
<h2> About me! </h2>

<p>
Iâ€™m Ajith Kusalakumar, I am currently a <strong> Computer Science student </strong> at <strong> Algoma University </strong> and a aspiring <strong> back-end developer </strong> who knows a little bit about centering a div. 
</p>
<p>
I love writing code! Before studying Computer Science, I completed a degree in <strong> Mathematics and Physics </strong> from <strong> University of Toronto </strong>. When I was studying physics, I dabbled in programming and found my passion for it. When I graduated with my degree, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. So I went back to school for Computer Science taking courses at an accelerated pace. 
 </p>
<p>
ðŸ‘€ Over the past few years, i became proficent at <strong> Java, Python, JavaScript</strong> and familiar with <strong> C, C++, Swift</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
ðŸŒ± My current projects are using <strong>Node.js, React.js,</strong> and <strong> TypeScript </strong>. I am trying to get better at web development. I am currently focusing on backend web dev, but I am also acquainted with IOS development.
